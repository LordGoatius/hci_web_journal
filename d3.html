        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        Since we are working on usability tests and design recommendations for the MBA website form navigation, we will be using the 
        <a href="https://willamette.edu/mba/index.html">Willamette MBA website</a> as our prototype.
        <h3>User Manual/Installation Guide</h3>
        Please access the website by clicking on <a href="https://willamette.edu/mba/index.html">this link</a>. There is no installation required to access this website.
        <h3>User Population</h3>
        Does the described user population required for the test session correspond to the user segments defined in the project proposal?
        <ul>
            <li>Here are the required user population we are focusing on: 
                </li>
            <li>Willamette CAS 1st, 2nd, 3rd year students (preferably who have no experience on navigating the Willamette MBA website
                </li>
            <li>Non-Willamette students who are interested in Willamette MBA program who have no experience navigating any Willamette sites (this includes the undergraduate site)
                </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Usability Goals</h3>
        What usability goals will be tested?
        <ul>
            <li>How difficult or easy it is for users to access a certain form: we are measuring it by how many clicks (from the main page) 
                required for the participants to find the forms, and how long does it take for them to access the form. 
                We also want to keep track on how much time and number of pages visited until the participants ask for hints 
            </li>
            <li>Here are the specific forms:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://grad-apply.willamette.edu/register/request-info">Atkinson Graduate School of Management Inquiry Form</a>   </li>
                    <li><a href="https://grad-apply.willamette.edu/register/?id=9986ef44-4302-4357-9a57-4b7069f27bff">MBA Request Information (all programs included)</a>   </li>

                </ul>
           </li>
            <li>How well does the informations provided on the website (links, buttons, title of pages) in leading participants to access certain forms
                <ul>
                    <li>We want to know how much information participants are getting by just looking at the website pages, and whether they help them navigate through the website
                    </li>
                    <li>The post-survey will let participants answer some questions regarding this
                    </li>
                </ul>
           <li>What navigation barriers or challenges do users face on the current site?</li>
               <ul>
                   <li>Is the website accessible for people to use in general?&nbsp;</li>
                   <li>Does the website provide information that is needed by users?&nbsp;</li>
                   <li>Is the website's structures organized in a way that is helpful for users?&nbsp;</li>
                   <li>We will be analyzing the user&rsquo;s actions and thoughts (when they are thinking out loud), and from their post-survey answers</li>
               </ul>
           <li>Is there a website's design component that could impact the user's experience in navigating the website?&nbsp;               
               <ul>
                   <li>Are the font&rsquo;s in the website helpful for users?&nbsp;</li>
                   <li>Is there any design component in the website that is harmful for users that prevent users from exploring the website?&nbsp;</li>
                   <li>The post-survey will let participants answer some questions regarding this</li>
               </ul> 
           </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Usability Test Procedure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Overview of Usability Test Procedure:
                <ul>
                    <li>The usability test will be done online via Zoom, with the participant&rsquo;s screen being shared. This allow us to record the interaction for data analysis</li>
                    <li>Participants will be asked if they would be fine with being recorded. Participants will have the choice to turn off the camera if they are more comfortable with that.The recording will not be distributed to anyone other than the examiner (Chris and Jimmy) and Professor. Agbo (if he wishes to have them for grading).&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>In each usability test, the participants will be given about 5 tasks to complete. The user test can last about 30 - 60 minutes</li>
                    <li>Participants can:&nbsp;            
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask for hints to the examiner if they feel lost in any tasks</li>
                            <li>Get a break if they wish to have one</li>
                            <li>It is participant&rsquo;s rights to stop or not continue the usability test if they wish so</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the usability tasks have been completed, the examiner will administer the post survey to the participants</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Equipment needed:&nbsp;
                <ul>
                    <li>Participants:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each participant needs a working laptop/computer with an internet connection to access the website</li>
                            <li>Each participant&rsquo;s laptop need to have a working microphone and speaker in order to communicate with examiner on Zoom&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Each participant should have Zoom installed on their device to do the usability test online.&nbsp;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Examiner:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Examiner needs to have a working laptop/computer with an internet connection to open the Zoom meeting</li>
                            <li>Examiner has to have a working microphone and speaker in order to communicate with participants on Zoom</li>
                            <li>Examiner&rsquo;s device need to be equipped to record a Zoom recording of the usability test, this will make it easier to come back and watch the recording during data analysis</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>How should your prototype be handled?            
                <ul>
                    <li>Since the prototype is already a live website from Willamette, participant should be able to access it by click the 
                        link: <a href="https://willamette.edu/mba/">Willamette MBA website</a></li>
                    <li>If any questions or problem occurs during the user test, participants should notify the examiner.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Examiners:
                <ul>
                    <li>At least 1 examiner in every usability test required</li>
                    <li>Examiners&rsquo; duty: All to examiner&rsquo;s best practice and interview protocol are in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12L-htZk8rmgoJaDSWsBQQboWldF4OcUjYZXv6dnrCOE/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Examiner Guide to Usability Test</a></li>
                    <li>What to measure:&nbsp;
                        <ul>
                            <li>Time that participants take on finishing each tasks given to them&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>How many clicks or how many pages that participants need to visit in order to get to the form that they are looking for</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This will be compared by the smallest amount of pages visited (the shortest path) to access to certain form</li>
                        </ul>
                            <li>Examiner should takes notes on what issues that participants came across while attempting to complete the tasks</li>
                            <li>Examiner should record barriers and struggles participants encounter</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The full examiner's guide procedures can be found here: <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12L-htZk8rmgoJaDSWsBQQboWldF4OcUjYZXv6dnrCOE/edit?usp=sharing">Examiner's Guide</a></strong></p>

        <h3>Usability Evaluation</h3>
        <p>A detailed usability evaluation plan should enable independent evaluators to assess the design with respect to the stated goals for the project.</p>
        <p>Our evaluation plan includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Measuring the users clicks to access certain forms will allow us to evalutate a kind of "natrual mapping" that the MBA website has -
                effectively measuring how natrual it is to navigate compared to a real world environment.
            </li>
            <li>
                We can measure use control/freedom through recognizing the ability for the user to come to a "home base" webpage they're comfortable with,
                or by measuring how the user was able to backtrack through the pages when they recognize they might not be going the right direction.
            </li>
            <li>
                We can measure consistency through the users through their verbalized thought process. If 2 links look similar, and one got them closer, they
                will most likely click the next, and if performing this action takes them further we know that the internal consistency isn't what it should be.
            </li>
            <li>
                Recognition can be measured by evaluating whether the expected outcome of navigating through a link matches the actual outcome. For example,
                if there is a link that has the exact same name as the form they are navigating to, then it would make sense to click on it,
                but if it instead takes them to a page that has a lot of other stuff and the link to the form is hidden on the page somewhere, this 
                is something they'd have to remember, and which devalues their recognition of where they wish to navigate to.
            </li>
            <li>
                Other miscellaneous things can indicate the design quality:
                <ul>
                    <li>Time it takes to navigate to a particular page</li>
                    <li>User feedback on what parts they struggled with</li>
                    <li>Post-survey data is another very valuable resource which should contain specific things that they struggled with</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
